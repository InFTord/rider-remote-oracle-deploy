<h1 align="center">Idea Remote Oracle Deploy</h1>

You want to use Oracle's free tier to launch a remote development server of IntelliJ IDEA but noticed that Jetbrains still doesn't support ARM? This is the script for you!

## ⚙️ Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThallesP/idea-remote-oracle-deploy
cd idea-remote-oracle-deploy
```

## 🚀 How to run the script
```bash
sh setup_remote_server.sh
```

## 🤔  Questions

### Can this script run on non-oracle machines?
It probably can, but I haven't tested it yet, you can give it a try and show us the results by opening an issue!
